You can create your own plugins using the supplied plugin template (exApiTools.Plugin.Template).
To do this, first install the template on your system:
dotnet new install exApiTools.Plugin.Template.1.0.0.nupkg

Then, in a folder where you want your plugin sources, run:
dotnet new exApiPlugin -n MyPlugin
A folder with all the required files will be created, study its contents and develop your plugin.
When you want to test your plugin with HUD, simply put in Plugins/Source like this:
Plugins
|
->Source
  |
  ->MyPlugin
    |
    ->MyPlugin.csproj
      file1.cs
      file2.cs
      ...
After this, launch the HUD and you'll either be presented with compilation issues or the plugin will load.
